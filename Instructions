* rename_for_noiseless.py - just for noiseless
0) preprocessing_benign_frames.py  *only for training data
1) file_restructure.py
2) S_beam_1_frames_removal.py -> Remove any noisy data in the headon folder that has s_beam == 1
      *only if you want to select 1000 files
      2.1) select_1000_files_per_behavior.py -> select 1000 files with the most frames from each behavior and place them in data_preprocessed folder
3) train_validation_split.py or train_test_split.py * only for training data
Put all the train/val/test folders to Hmm_data folder
Working Dataset -> HMM_data
4) data_preprocessing_new.py
5) Multiclass_model_train.py
6) Multiclass_model_test.py

* check_file_length.py -> Check whether the updated files have 500 frames and 24 features
